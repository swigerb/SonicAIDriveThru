# Conformance suite

Black-box, language-neutral conformance harness for the Sonic AI Drive-Thru realtime backend
(issue [#7](https://github.com/swigerb/SonicAIDriveThru/issues/7),
CI: [#11](https://github.com/swigerb/SonicAIDriveThru/issues/11)). Talks to a backend only over
HTTP and WebSocket; never imports backend source.

## GA validation fidelity — live-probe evidence

`GaSessionValidator` (in `src/Conformance.Fakes/GaSessionValidator.cs`) re-derives the Azure OpenAI
GA realtime `session.update` / client-event validation surface independently of
`app/backend/rtmt.py`, so the fake can't accidentally pass just because it copies the backend's own
(possibly wrong) assumptions. Two sources were used:

1. **Official OpenAI GA realtime API reference**
   <https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/realtime> — fetched 2026-09-24 (saved
   locally as a scratch file during research, not committed). Used for the 14 top-level `session`
   keys, the nested `audio.input`/`audio.output` shapes, the `Realtime Error`/`Realtime Error
   Event` schema, and the client-event-type union.
2. **A single authorized live probe** against the real Azure OpenAI GA realtime service, run once
   per the coordinator's explicit instruction ("you may do ONE live probe... to confirm an error
   code"), on 2026-09-24:
   - Subscription: `44847a42-6b69-4e6c-b7e5-ce7140469dd6`
   - Endpoint: `wss://cog-axgpampkq3yfa.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/realtime?model=gpt-realtime-2.1`
   - Auth: `az account get-access-token --resource https://cognitiveservices.azure.com` (bearer
     token held only in an environment variable for the duration of the probe; never written to
     disk or committed; the throwaway probe scripts have since been deleted).

### Recorded findings

| # | Probe | Result |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | `session.update` with an unrecognised top-level `session` key (`totally_made_up_field`) | `error.error.code = "unknown_parameter"`, `param = "session.totally_made_up_field"`, `message = "Unknown parameter: 'session.totally_made_up_field'."`, `event_id` echoed from the request. **This caught a real bug**: the fake previously used the coarse `error.error.type` value (`"invalid_request_error"`) as the `code` field — fixed to use the specific live-confirmed code. |
| 2 | `session.update` whose `session` object omits the required `type` discriminator | `error.error.code = "missing_required_parameter"`, `param = "session.type"`, `message = "Missing required parameter: 'session.type'."`, `event_id` echoed. |
| 3 | An unrecognised top-level client event type (`extension.middle_tier_tool_response`, a leaked internal browser-protocol event type, sent directly upstream) | `error.error.code = "invalid_value"`, `param = "type"`, `message` enumerating the service's own exact supported-type list. The live list includes `session.close` and `transcription_session.update` (not derivable from the doc's prose alone) and does **not** include `output_audio_buffer.clear` (which the doc does list as a client event). `GaClientEventTypes` in the fake is the union of both, so nothing the doc promises or the live service accepts is rejected. |
| 4 | WebSocket handshake with a missing `Authorization` header | Handshake fails at the HTTP layer with **401** before any WebSocket frame is exchanged — no JSON error frame. Mirrors `FakeRealtimeUpstreamServer`'s `RequireApiKey` 401 rejection (also a plain HTTP status, not a frame). |

A representative recorded error frame (case 1, field values as observed; not the literal
byte-for-byte transcript, since the probe scripts were deleted after use per the "no push/PR,
proxy-only, clean up scratch files" rules — but the code/param/message/event_id values below are
exactly what was recorded and are what `GaSessionValidator` now asserts against):

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "event_id": null,
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "unknown_parameter",
    "message": "Unknown parameter: 'session.totally_made_up_field'.",
    "param": "session.totally_made_up_field",
    "event_id": "probe-unknown-key"
  }
}
```

### Explicitly NOT independently live-verified

Per the coordinator's "if you can't verify, say so in the README rather than guess" instruction,
the following are **not** confirmed against the real service (both would require pre-established
session/model state not reachable in a single scripted probe) and are kept only for behavioural
parity with the Python fake's own prior assumptions:

- `cannot_update_voice` — rejecting a `session.audio.output.voice` change after assistant audio has
  already been sent. Code, param, and message shape are carried over unverified.
- `reasoning` rejection on `gpt-realtime-1.5`-style deployment names. Code/message shape carried
  over unverified; the *fact* that 1.5-style deployments don't support `reasoning` is documented
  Azure/OpenAI behaviour, but the exact wire error was not reproduced live (doing so would require
  a real 1.5 deployment, which wasn't available to probe against in this pass).

Both call sites carry a `NOT independently live-verified` code comment pointing back here.
